# **Geodata Science - Geophysics**

## Repository
Data and codes for research in terrestrial data concatenation and gravity data processing 

## Motivation
This repository was initially created as a requirement for the Data Science and Software Engineering undergraduate program at the Virtual University of the State of São Paulo (UNIVESP).
Geodata Science (GDS) refers to an interdisciplinary research field focused on exploring geoscience data. In this project, the main objective is to prepare geophysical data for future use, interpretations, and modeling.
